"Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)","Technologies whose purpose is privacy. Focus on minimizing possession of personal data without losing functionality."
"Privacy Engineers (Goal)","Focus on achieving 'freedom from conditions' that create problems for individuals during data processing."
"Identifiability","The degree to which data can be directly attributed to an individual."
"Linkability","The amount of effort required to link data to a specific individual."
"Strong Identifiers","Data identifying without context (e.g., SSN, Passport #)."
"Weak Identifiers","General data needing combination for identification (e.g., Height, Home Address)."
"Quasi-Identifiers","Data combined with external knowledge to link it to an individual."
"Suppression (Anonymization)","Removing identifying information or values from a data set."
"Generalization (Anonymization)","Reducing granularity by replacing specific info with more general elements (e.g., removing house #)."
"Top- and Bottom-Coding","Grouping extreme ends of a range into a single category (e.g., Income > $100k) to hide outliers."
"Noise Addition","Replacing actual values with data from the same class to maintain statistical properties while hiding individuals."
"Anonymity Metrics (3 Types)","k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness."
"Aggregation","Using statistics from groups of records rather than individual data."
"Differential Privacy","Mathematical framework introducing 'noise' to provide a guarantee of indistinguishability and plausible deniability."
