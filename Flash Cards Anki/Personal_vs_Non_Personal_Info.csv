"Personal Information (PI) (General Scope)","Information that protects 'personal information' or PII. Distinction depends on how easily data can be associated with a specific person."
"Identified Individual","Someone who can be ascertained with certainty (e.g., via SSN)."
"Identifiable Individual","Someone who can be indirectly identified through a combination of factors (e.g., City + Gender + Birth Year)."
"Linkability","The amount of effort required to link data to a specific individual."
"IP Addresses (Regulatory View)","Historically non-personal, but the FTC increasingly views static IP addresses as identifiable PI."
"Strong Identifiers","Data that is identifying without additional context (e.g., SSN, Passport #)."
"Weak Identifiers","General data belonging to multiple people, needed in combination for identification (e.g., Height, Home Address)."
"Quasi-Identifiers","Data combined with external knowledge to link it to an individual."
"Suppression (Anonymization)","Removing identifying information or values from a data set."
"Generalization (Anonymization)","Reducing granularity by replacing specific info with more general elements (e.g., removing house # from address)."
"Top- and Bottom-Coding","Grouping the extreme ends of a range into a single category (e.g., income > $100k or < $20k) to hide outliers."
"Noise Addition (Anonymization)","Replacing actual values with data from the same class to maintain statistical properties while hiding individuals."
"Aggregation","Using statistics from groups of records rather than individual data."
"Differential Privacy","A mathematical framework introducing 'noise' to provide a guarantee of indistinguishability for individuals in a dataset."
"Anonymity Metrics","Methods to measure success of anonymization: k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness."
"Non-Public Information","The primary focus of privacy protection laws (as opposed to Public Records)."
"Public Records","Information like court filings that is generally less protected."
