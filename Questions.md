## Answers

**1. Which legal liability category is exclusively enforced by government bodies and prevents private individuals from filing a lawsuit?**
* **Answer: D. Criminal liability**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s D:** Criminal law addresses wrongs against society as a whole. Only the government (prosecutors) can bring criminal charges. Private citizens cannot file criminal lawsuits; they can only report crimes.
    * **Why not others:** *Negligence*, *Civil liability*, and *Invasion of privacy* are all matters of civil law, where one private party (the plaintiff) sues another (the defendant) for damages.

**2. Under the FCRA, what specific action converts a standard consumer report into an "investigative consumer report"?**
* **Answer: B. Interviewing neighbors or associates to gather information on the applicant’s character.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) makes a distinct classification for reports that go beyond just paper records (credit history, criminal records). If the background check involves **personal interviews** to determine reputation, character, or mode of living, it is an "investigative consumer report" and carries stricter notification requirements.
    * **Why not others:** Searching public records (A, C) or credit history (D) constitutes a standard consumer report, not an investigative one.

**3. A consumer is on the National Do-Not-Call (DNC) registry but still receives sales calls from her current Internet Service Provider (ISP). Is the ISP violating the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR)?**
* **Answer: D. No, because the "Existing Business Relationship" (EBR) exemption allows them to call current customers.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s D:** The TSR includes an **Existing Business Relationship (EBR)** exception. Companies can call a consumer for up to 18 months after the consumer's last purchase, delivery, or payment, even if the consumer is on the National DNC list.
    * **Caveat:** If the consumer explicitly asks *that specific company* to stop calling, the company must honor that request regardless of the EBR.

**4. Two employees frequently meet in the breakroom to discuss unionizing. Management suddenly installs a security camera pointed directly at their table. What is the primary legal concern here?**
* **Answer: B. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) may consider this surveillance an illegal attempt to intimidate workers exercising their rights to organize.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects the right of employees to organize. The NLRB has ruled that surveillance (or creating the impression of surveillance) of union activities is an unfair labor practice because it intimidates workers.
    * **Why not others:** While privacy waivers (C) and notice (D) are general best practices, they do not override the federal prohibition on interfering with union activities.

**5. A marketing firm uses a professional athlete’s photograph in an ad campaign without getting permission or paying them. Which specific privacy tort would the athlete cite in a lawsuit?**
* **Answer: C. Appropriation**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** **Appropriation** (or "Right of Publicity") is the privacy tort specifically defined as the unauthorized use of another person's name or likeness for one's own benefit (usually commercial).
    * **Why not others:** *Intrusion upon seclusion* (D) involves spying; *False light* (B) involves misleading representations; *Public disclosure* (A) involves revealing embarrassing secrets. None of these fit a commercial ad usage.

**6. When designing a corporate privacy training program, which of the following approaches is generally considered ineffective or incorrect?**
* **Answer: C. Providing the exact same training content to every employee regardless of their specific job function.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Effective privacy training must be **role-based**. Marketing teams need training on opt-outs/consent; HR needs training on employee records; IT needs training on security controls. A "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to address specific risks.
    * **Why not others:** Using CBT (B) is standard for scalability; explaining specific roles (D) is a best practice.

**7. Which acronym represents the broadest category of data capable of distinguishing or tracing an individual's identity?**
* **Answer: A. PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** **PII** is the standard umbrella term for any information that can identify an individual (Name, SSN, Email, etc.).
    * **Why not others:** *PHI* (B) is limited to health info; *PCI* (C) is limited to credit card info; *PFI* is not a standard privacy acronym.

**8. When creating a data inventory for a privacy program, which of the following records would typically be excluded because it does not contain personal information?**
* **Answer: C. Internal manufacturing work orders and machine logs.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Data inventories track *personal information*. Manufacturing logs that track machine performance, output, or maintenance schedules generally do not contain data about identifiable individuals.
    * **Why not others:** Payroll (A), Resumes (B), and Transaction histories (D) all inherently contain sensitive PII.

**9. Which federal statute was primarily enacted to force financial institutions to assist the government in detecting and preventing money laundering?**
* **Answer: C. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The **Bank Secrecy Act (1970)** is the primary U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) law. It requires banks to keep records and file reports (like SARs) that have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations.
    * **Why not others:** RFPA (B) *protects* privacy from the government; ECPA (A) covers electronic comms.

**10. What is the legal term for a settlement document in which a company agrees to stop alleged illegal practices and implement compliance measures without admitting to a violation of the law?**
* **Answer: B. Consent decree**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the standard mechanism the FTC uses to settle privacy enforcement actions. The company agrees to a **Consent Decree** (often lasting 20 years) to avoid a trial and admits no liability, but agrees to audits and fines for future violations.

**11. Which Article of the U.S. Constitution specifically establishes the judicial branch and defines its power?**
* **Answer: C. Article III**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The U.S. Constitution is structured as follows:
        * Article I: Legislative (Congress)
        * Article II: Executive (President)
        * **Article III: Judicial (Courts)**
        * Article IV: States' relations

**12. Which federal regulation mandates that entities properly destroy consumer information derived from credit reports to prevent unauthorized access?**
* **Answer: C. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA)**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** **FACTA** (an amendment to FCRA) introduced the **Disposal Rule**. It explicitly requires any person who possesses consumer information for a business purpose to take reasonable measures to destroy it (shredding, burning, wiping) to prevent "dumpster diving" identity theft.

**13. Which mechanism allows the President (Executive Branch) to limit the power of the Legislative Branch?**
* **Answer: C. Veto power**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** In the system of checks and balances, the President checks Congress by refusing to sign a bill into law (the **Veto**).
    * **Why not others:** *Judicial Review* (A) is a power of the Courts; *Confirmation* (B) is a power of the Senate (Legislature) over the Executive/Judicial.

**14. What is the primary intersection between privacy protections and employment antidiscrimination statutes?**
* **Answer: C. Inappropriate access to personal data can facilitate illegal discriminatory hiring or firing decisions.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Privacy laws in HR often exist to prevent managers from seeing "protected class" data (like age, religion, or disability) before a hiring decision is made. If they see the data (a privacy failure), they might use it to discriminate (an employment law violation).

**15. State data breach notification laws typically require reporting to all of the following groups EXCEPT:**
* **Answer: D. Immediate family members of the affected subjects**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s D:** Breach laws focus on mitigating harm.
        * Notifying the **individual** (A) allows them to freeze credit.
        * Notifying **Regulators** (B) allows for enforcement.
        * Notifying **CRAs** (C) helps preventing fraud.
        * There is no legal requirement to notify a victim's family members; doing so might actually violate the victim's privacy further.

**16. Which corporate officer is designated to oversee the development, implementation, and maintenance of an organization's privacy policies?**
* **Answer: C. Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The **CPO** is the C-suite role dedicated to privacy compliance, policy creation, and data protection strategy.
    * **Why not others:** *CIO* (A) manages IT infrastructure; *CISO* manages security (protecting data from hackers); *CPO* focuses on how data is *used* and *collected* legally.


**17. An individual submits their personal health history to a medical research institute. In the context of privacy terminology, what is this individual considered?**
* **Answer: C. Data Subject**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** In privacy frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), the **Data Subject** is the identified or identifiable natural person whom the data is about.
    * **Why not others:** The institute is the *Controller* (determines purpose); the cloud provider might be the *Processor*.

**18. Under the Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA), which of the following positions would generally be PROTECTED from mandatory polygraph testing?**
* **Answer: D. A kindergarten teacher at a private school**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s D:** The EPPA prohibits most private employers from using polygraphs. Teachers do not fall under any exemption.
    * **Why not others:** The EPPA explicitly **exempts** (allows testing for):
        * Government/Federal employees (A).
        * Pharmaceutical employees handling controlled substances (B).
        * Security services (armored car, alarm companies) (C).

**19. Which privacy seal provider settled with the FTC regarding allegations that it failed to properly recertify the companies displaying its privacy seal?**
* **Answer: B. TRUSTe**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** In a landmark case, **TRUSTe** (now TrustArc) settled with the FTC. The FTC alleged that TRUSTe failed to conduct annual recertifications of companies displaying their seal, despite claiming they did so. This was considered deceptive under Section 5 of the FTC Act.

**20. Under Washington State's biometric privacy legislation, which data type is explicitly excluded from the definition of a "biometric identifier"?**
* **Answer: D. Digital photographs**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s D:** Washington's law (and Texas's) excludes **photographs, video, and audio recordings** from the strict definition of "biometric identifier." This is to prevent ordinary photography or CCTV from triggering the complex consent requirements required for scanning fingerprints or retinae.
    * **Note:** This differs from Illinois (BIPA), where photographs *can* be considered biometric data if used to generate a face scan. However, the question specifies **Washington**.

**21. Who is considered a "covered entity" required to comply with the ADA’s employment provisions?**
* **Answer: B. Employers with 15 or more employees, employment agencies, and labor unions.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Title I of the **ADA** applies to private employers with **15 or more employees**, as well as employment agencies and labor unions.
    * **Why not others:** Smaller employers (<15) are generally exempt from the federal ADA (though state laws may still apply).

**22. How did the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) change the definition of "disability"?**
* **Answer: C. It expanded the definition to include episodic conditions or those in remission.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The **ADAAA** was enacted to overturn Supreme Court decisions that had too narrowly defined disability. It explicitly states that an impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.
    * **Why not others:** It *broadened* the scope, explicitly rejecting the idea that mitigating measures (like medication) should be considered when determining if a disability exists (refuting D).

**23. According to the substantive rules of the ADA, when is an employer permitted to require a medical examination of a job applicant?**
* **Answer: B. Only after a conditional offer of employment has been extended.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The ADA strictly prohibits medical exams *before* an offer is made to prevent discrimination based on perceived disabilities. Once a **conditional offer** is made, an employer can require an exam, provided all entering employees in that category are subject to the same exam.
    * **Why not others:** Pre-offer exams (A) are illegal.

**24. Under the ADA, an employer must provide "reasonable accommodation" to a qualified individual unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would:**
* **Answer: B. Result in an "undue hardship" involving significant difficulty or expense.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** **Undue Hardship** is the specific legal standard for declining an accommodation. It is determined by looking at the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size and resources of the employer.
    * **Why not others:** Changing "essential functions" (D) is not required; the employee must be able to perform them (with or without accommodation).

**25. Which agency is responsible for the federal administrative enforcement of the ADA?**
* **Answer: B. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The **EEOC** enforces Title I of the ADA (employment).
    * **Why not others:** The FTC handles consumer protection/privacy; HHS handles medical privacy (HIPAA).

**26. Regarding legal remedies, which of the following is true of the ADA?**
* **Answer: C. It permits private causes of action in the same way as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The ADA adopts the powers, remedies, and procedures of **Title VII** of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This includes the right for individuals to file a lawsuit in federal court (a **Private Right of Action**) after exhausting administrative remedies with the EEOC.
    * **Why not others:** It is not limited to government enforcement (A).

**27. Who is considered a "covered entity" required to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)?**
* **Answer: B. "Financial institutions," including banks, securities brokers, casinos, and card clubs.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The BSA defines "financial institution" very broadly. It includes not just banks, but also broker-dealers, casinos (with revenue >$1M), card clubs, and money services businesses (MSBs).
    * **Why not others:** It is not limited to just banks (A) or government agencies (D). While cash processing is relevant, businesses don't become "covered entities" just for processing cash unless they fit the MSB definition; general businesses have reporting duties (Form 8300) but aren't the primary "financial institutions" regulated in the same way.

**28. What is the primary objective of the record-keeping requirements mandated by the BSA?**
* **Answer: B. To maintain records identified as having a "high degree of usefulness" in criminal or national security investigations.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This phrase ("high degree of usefulness") comes directly from the statute. The purpose is to create a paper trail for law enforcement to track money laundering, tax evasion, and terrorist financing.
    * **Why not others:** While it aids the IRS (A), the specific statutory standard is "usefulness" in investigations, not just taxation.

**29. Under the BSA’s substantive rules, for what minimum period must financial institutions generally keep records useful for investigations?**
* **Answer: C. Five years.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The standard retention period for BSA records (including Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)) is **5 years**.
    * **Why not others:** 2, 3, or 7 years are standard in other laws (like some tax records), but 5 is the magic number for the BSA.

**30. Which of the following is a key requirement for financial institutions under the BSA to prevent money laundering and verify client identities?**
* **Answer: A. "Know Your Customer" (KYC) requirements.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** **KYC** (and CIP - Customer Identification Program) is the fundamental preventative component of the BSA (strengthened by the USA PATRIOT Act). Banks must verify who their clients are to prevent anonymity in the financial system.
    * **Why not others:** Real-time access (D) and public reports (B) are not requirements and would violate other privacy norms.

**31. Which agency has the primary authority to enforce the BSA through the imposition of civil penalties?**
* **Answer: B. The Department of the Treasury (via FinCEN).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The **Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)**, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is the administrator of the BSA.
    * **Why not others:** The DOJ handles *criminal* prosecutions, but FinCEN handles the *civil* administration and rulemaking. The FTC/CFPB do not strictly enforce the BSA.

**32. Regarding legal remedies and enforcement, which of the following is true of the Bank Secrecy Act?**
* **Answer: C. It does not provide for a private cause of action.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The BSA is a regulatory reporting statute. If a bank fails to follow it, the government fines the bank. A private citizen cannot sue a bank for failing to file a SAR, nor for filing one about them (banks actually have immunity for filing SARs).
    * **Why not others:** There is no mechanism for individual lawsuits (A/B).

**33. Who is primarily regulated by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 regarding subscriber privacy?**
* **Answer: B. Any person providing "cable services" (one-way transmissions) and entities they own or control that provide wire or radio communications.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The Act applies to "cable operators." This definition covers companies providing one-way transmission of video/other programming.
    * **Why not others:** It does NOT generally apply to broadband Internet (A) (which is regulated differently, often under the Telecommunications Act or FTC oversight depending on the current net neutrality stance), nor essentially content creators (D).

**34. What type of information does the Act specifically protect?**
* **Answer: C. Personally identifiable information (PII) from consumers.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The Act focuses on "personally identifiable information" collected by the cable operator.
    * **Why not others:** It explicitly **excludes** aggregated data (B) that does not identify particular persons. It is about subscriber privacy, not company secrets (D).

**35. Under the Act’s substantive rules, how often must a cable operator provide privacy notices to its subscribers?**
* **Answer: C. At the time of entering into a service agreement and at least once a year thereafter.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This is a strict requirement of the Cable Act. Subscribers must be told about PII collection, use, and disclosure rights initially and **annually**.
    * **Why not others:** Just once (A) is insufficient; monthly (D) is not required.

**36. When is a cable operator permitted to disclose a subscriber’s personally identifiable information without prior written or electronic consent?**
* **Answer: A. Whenever it is necessary to render services or conduct legitimate business activities related to cable service.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** The Act allows disclosure *without consent* if it is "necessary to render... service" (e.g., giving an address to a technician or a billing processor).
    * **Why not others:** Marketing (B) generally requires consent or an opt-out depending on the specific nuance, but the "service necessity" is the primary statutory exception. Law enforcement disclosure usually requires a court order, not just a verbal request (C).

**37. Which of the following describes the federal administrative enforcement of the Act?**
* **Answer: B. It is enforced under the Communications Act (overseen by the FCC).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The Cable Act is part of the broader Communications Act of 1934. The **FCC** has the primary regulatory authority over cable operators.
    * **Why not others:** While the FTC (A) handles general privacy, the FCC handles strict comms regulations.

**38. Regarding legal remedies, what is true about the private cause of action provided by the Act?**
* **Answer: B. Individuals can sue for actual damages or statutory damages of $1,000, whichever is higher, plus punitive damages and attorney's fees.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The Cable Act provides a robust **Private Right of Action**. Aggrieved subscribers can sue in federal court.
    * **Why not others:** It allows for statutory damages (usually $100/day or $1,000 total), so actual financial loss (C) isn't strictly required to get into court. It is NOT restricted to state courts (D).

**39. To be considered a "business" subject to the CCPA, a legal entity must operate for profit in California and meet which of the following revenue thresholds?**
* **Answer: B. More than $25 million in annual gross revenue as of January 1 of the preceding year.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The CCPA defines a business as a for-profit entity in CA that meets one of three thresholds: (1) >$25M gross revenue, (2) buys/sells/shares data of 100,000+ consumers/households (CPRA update from 50k), or (3) derives 50% of revenue from selling/sharing data.
    * **Why not others:** $10M and $50M are not the specific legislative thresholds.

**40. How does the CCPA define a "consumer" entitled to privacy rights?**
* **Answer: B. Any natural person who is a resident of California.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** A "consumer" is defined broadly as a natural person who is a California resident.
    * **Why not others:** It excludes corporations and non-residents. It applies regardless of whether they have a registered account or have physically purchased goods (just browsing can trigger data collection).

**41. Under the CCPA’s "What It Applies To" section, which of the following is generally excluded from the definition of personal information?**
* **Answer: C. Information that has been de-identified or aggregated.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The CCPA explicitly **excludes** de-identified or aggregated consumer information from the definition of "personal information" because it cannot reasonably be linked to a specific individual.
    * **Why not others:** IP addresses, geolocation data, and browsing history (A, B) are considered personal information.

**42. Which of the following is NOT one of the specific individual rights granted to California residents under the CCPA/CPRA?**
* **Answer: C. The right to absolute deletion of all data, including data required for legal compliance.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The **Right to Delete** is NOT absolute. Businesses can retain data for specific reasons, such as completing a transaction, detecting security incidents, or complying with a legal obligation.
    * **Why not others:** The rights to correct (A), opt-out (B), and limit sensitive data use (D) are all core rights granted by the CPRA.

**43. What is the specific consent requirement for a business to "sell" or "share" the personal information of a minor aged 13 to 16?**
* **Answer: A. The business must obtain the express opt-in consent of the minor.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** For consumers aged 13-16, the business must get affirmative authorization (**opt-in**) from the minor themselves before selling/sharing data.
    * **Why not others:** Parental consent (B) is required only for children **under 13**. No consent (C) applies to adults (16+).

**44. Regarding organizational requirements, what must a business do to satisfy the CCPA’s "Right to Opt-Out"?**
* **Answer: B. Prominently display a means for individuals to opt-out, such as a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The law requires a clear and conspicuous link on the homepage titled **"Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information"** (or honoring a recognized Opt-Out Preference Signal like GPC).
    * **Why not others:** Mailing letters (C) or phone-only options (A) are generally insufficient for online businesses.

**45. Which dedicated state-level agency is primarily responsible for enforcing the CCPA and conducting rulemaking?**
* **Answer: B. The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The **CPRA** (which amended CCPA) created the **California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA)**, the first dedicated privacy agency in the US, to enforce and implement the law.
    * **Why not others:** The AG (A) used to enforce it exclusively, but now shares/transferred much power to the CPPA.

**46. What are the potential civil penalties for an intentional violation of the CCPA?**
* **Answer: C. Up to $7,500 per violation.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Civil penalties are up to $2,500 for unintentional violations and up to **$7,500 for intentional violations** (or violations involving minors).
    * **Why not others:** $2,500 (B) is the cap for *accidental* violations.

**47. The CCPA provides a limited private right of action for consumers. In which scenario can a consumer sue a business directly?**
* **Answer: B. For an unauthorized access and exfiltration of personal information resulting from a failure to maintain reasonable security.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The private right of action is limited *only* to data breaches where non-encrypted/non-redacted personal information is subject to unauthorized access due to a failure to maintain **reasonable security**.
    * **Why not others:** Consumers cannot sue for general privacy violations (like failure to provide notice (A) or failure to delete (C)); those are enforced by the Agency.

**48. What statutory damages can an individual consumer recover in a private lawsuit under the CCPA for a qualified data breach?**
* **Answer: B. Between $100 and $750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages, whichever is greater.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why not others:** Under the private right of action for data breaches, consumers can recover **statutory damages** between **$100 and $750** per consumer per incident, without needing to prove actual financial loss.

**49. Which of the following businesses is subject to the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act?**
* **Answer: B. A for-profit entity that does business in California and derives at least 50% of its annual revenue from selling or sharing personal information.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The AADC applies to entities that meet the definition of a "business" under the **CCPA**. Deriving 50% of revenue from data sales is one of the three thresholds to qualify as a CCPA business. To be subject to AADC, such a business must also provide services likely to be accessed by children.
    * **Why not others:** Non-profits (A) are generally exempt from CCPA/AADC. Being headquartered in CA (C) is not required (just "doing business" there). 1,000 children (D) is not a specific threshold (CCPA's data threshold is 100,000 consumers/households total).

**50. The Act applies to which type of digital offerings?**
* **Answer: B. Any "online service, product, or feature likely to be accessed by children."**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the specific scope of the law. It is broader than services "directed at" children (like COPPA); it includes general audience services if children are likely to access them (e.g., social media, games).
    * **Why not others:** It excludes delivery services, broadband providers, and government agencies (D). It is not limited to paid services (C) or toddlers (A).

**51. Under the Act’s substantive rules, what must a covered business complete before launching a new online product directed at children?**
* **Answer: B. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The AADC mandates that businesses complete a **DPIA** for any new feature likely to be accessed by children *before* it is offered to the public. This assessment must examine risks to children's well-being.
    * **Why not others:** FTC registration (D) is not required by this state law.

**52. Which of the following design practices is specifically restricted under the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act?**
* **Answer: B. The implementation of "dark patterns" designed to lead children to disclose more personal data than necessary.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The Act explicitly prohibits using **dark patterns** or other manipulative techniques to encourage children to provide personal information or weaken their privacy settings.
    * **Why not others:** Strong security (C) is encouraged, not restricted. High contrast (A) is a UI choice unrelated to privacy harm here.

**53. How is the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act enforced, and what are the potential remedies?**
* **Answer: A. It is enforced by the California Attorney General, with civil penalties of up to $7,500 for intentional violations per affected child.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** Enforcement is handled by the **California Attorney General**. Violations carry civil penalties of up to $2,500 (negligent) or $7,500 (intentional) **per affected child**.
    * **Why not others:** There is explicitly **NO Private Right of Action** (B). The CPPA (C) enforces CCPA, but AADC enforcement is specifically assigned to the AG (though there is some overlap in subject matter).

**54. To which of the following entities does COPPA apply?**
* **Answer: A. Any commercial website directed to children under 13.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** COPPA applies to operators of commercial websites or online services (including apps) that are either **directed to children under 13** or have **actual knowledge** they are collecting personal information from a child under 13.
    * **Why not others:** Non-profits (B) are generally exempt from FTC jurisdiction (and thus COPPA). Teenagers 13-16 (D) are not covered by COPPA (they are covered by CCPA/AADC).

**55. Under the definition of "Personal Information," what recently added identifiers are explicitly included following the 2025 amendments noted in your study guide?**
* **Answer: B. Government-issued identifiers and biometric identifiers.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Recent regulatory updates have modernized the definition of PI to explicitly include **biometric data** (fingerprints, face prints) and other identifiers that act as persistent online identifiers.
    * **Why not others:** Hobbies/City (A/C) alone are not PI unless combined with other identifiers.

**56. What is the primary requirement an operator must fulfill *prior* to any collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from a child?**
* **Answer: C. Obtain "verifiable parental consent."**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The cornerstone of COPPA is the requirement to obtain **Verifiable Parental Consent (VPC)** *before* collecting data.
    * **Why not others:** Notice to schools (B) is a specific exception for educational apps, but VPC is the general rule. DNT signals (A) are not part of COPPA.

**57. How does the COPPA "Safe Harbor" provision function?**
* **Answer: B. It deems an entity in compliance if they follow the guidelines of an FTC-approved participating seal program.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** COPPA incentivizes industry self-regulation by offering a **"Safe Harbor."** If a company joins an approved program (like kidSAFE, BBB, or TRUSTe) and follows their rules, they are deemed to be in compliance with COPPA.
    * **Why not others:** It does not grant total immunity (C) or waive security requirements (A).

**58. Which agency is responsible for federal administrative enforcement of COPPA, and how are violations classified?**
* **Answer: C. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC); as an "unfair or deceptive" trade practice.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The **FTC** has the authority to issue regulations and enforce COPPA violations. Violations are treated as unfair or deceptive acts under **Section 5** of the FTC Act.
    * **Why not others:** The DOJ (A) typically files the suit on behalf of the FTC, but it's civil, not criminal. It is not an FCC (B) or HHS (D) matter.

**59. Regarding legal remedies for individual consumers, which of the following is true?**
* **Answer: B. It lacks a private cause of action, meaning individuals cannot sue under this act.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Like most FTC-enforced statutes, COPPA does **NOT** provide a private right of action. Parents cannot sue Facebook or TikTok directly for violating COPPA.
    * **Why not others:** State AGs can bring parens patriae suits (validating D as a partial truth, but B is the direct answer regarding consumers suing).

**60. Who is primarily considered a "covered entity" required to comply with CALEA’s design mandates?**
* **Answer: B. "Telecommunications carriers," including common carriers and those providing commercial mobile services.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** CALEA mandates that "telecommunications carriers" design their networks to allow for lawful intercepts. This definition has been expanded by the FCC to include broadband ISPs and VoIP providers.
    * **Why not others:** It generally exempts "information services" (A) (though the line is blurry with VoIP). Mere Wi-Fi spots (D) are not usually considered common carriers subject to these backend design rules.

**61. What does CALEA specifically regulate regarding telecommunications carriers?**
* **Answer: B. The "equipment, facilities, or services" used to provide communications.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the core subject matter—the *hardware and software infrastructure* must be built in a way that allows the government to plug in a "black box" for wiretapping when they have a warrant.
    * **Why not others:** It is not a pricing (A) or marketing (D) statute.

**62. Under CALEA’s substantive rules, what must carriers do regarding the design of their products and services?**
* **Answer: B. They must design their systems to provide access to communications as necessary to comply with a court order.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the "Substantive Rule" of CALEA, often called "Wiretap Ready." Systems must be capable of isolating and intercepting communications expeditiously.
    * **Why not others:** Carriers are not required to decrypt (A) unless they hold the key. Notification (D) would defeat the purpose of a secret wiretap.

**63. To ensure security and integrity, how must a surveillance capability be activated according to CALEA?**
* **Answer: B. It can only be activated with the affirmative intervention of an individual officer or employee of the carrier.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is a crucial security control. Law enforcement cannot just remotely "flip a switch" on their own. They must present the warrant to the carrier, and an employee of the carrier must physically or technically activate the intercept.
    * **Why not others:** Remote activation without carrier oversight (A) is prohibited to prevent abuse.

**64. Which official or agency is primarily responsible for the federal enforcement of CALEA?**
* **Answer: B. The United States Attorney General.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** CALEA is enforced by the **Attorney General** (DOJ). The Attorney General can file civil actions to force carriers to comply (and seek fines of $10,000/day).
    * **Why not others:** It is not an FTC (consumer protection) or Treasury issue.

**65. Regarding legal remedies, which of the following is true of CALEA?**
* **Answer: C. It does not provide for a private cause of action.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** CALEA is a technical mandate between the government and telecom carriers. If a carrier fails to build their network correctly, the government sues them. A private individual cannot sue a carrier for violating CALEA design rules.
    * **Why not others:** There is no mechanism for consumers to sue (A/B).

**66. Who is primarily required to comply with the confidentiality requirements of 42 C.F.R. Part 2?**
* **Answer: B. Any federally funded "program" (Part 2 Program) and anyone who receives covered records from such a program.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The rule applies to federally assisted programs that hold themselves out as providing substance use diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment. It also follows the data ("anyone who receives..."), prohibiting redisclosure.
    * **Why not others:** It limits it to federally funded programs (unlike general HIPAA which is broader), but "federally funded" is interpreted broadly (tax exempt status, Medicare acceptance). It is not limited to state-run clinics (A).

**67. What specific information does this Rule apply to?**
* **Answer: B. Any personally identifying information in records related to the treatment of substance abuse.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The key to Part 2 is the stigma. It protects records that would identify an individual *as having a substance use disorder* (SUD).
    * **Why not others:** It does NOT cover all medical records (A); if a patient breaks a leg and goes to the ER, that record isn't Part 2 just because the hospital gets federal funds. It is specific to SUD treatment.

**68. According to the substantive rules, which of the following is a prohibited use of covered patient records?**
* **Answer: B. Using the records for the purposes of criminal law enforcement.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Part 2 protects patients from having their treatment records used against them in criminal proceedings. Using these records to investigate or prosecute the patient is strictly prohibited absent a very specific court order.
    * **Why not others:** Care coordination (A) is a permitted purpose (often with consent).

**69. Under which of the following circumstances may covered records be disclosed without patient consent?**
* **Answer: B. In the case of a bona fide medical emergency.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Life-saving treatment takes precedence. If a patient overdoses and cannot consent, the Part 2 program can disclose relevant info to medical personnel treating the emergency.
    * **Why not others:** Marketing (A) always requires consent. Routine police checks (C) are absolutely prohibited.

**70. How are federal violations of the Substance Use Disorder Patient Record Rule typically enforced?**
* **Answer: B. By criminal prosecution through a local United States Attorney’s Office.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Unlike HIPAA (which is civil/administrative), violation of Part 2 is a **criminal offense**. It is enforced by the U.S. Attorney for that judicial district.
    * **Why not others:** It is not an FTC (civil) matter.

**71. Regarding legal remedies and state-level enforcement, which of the following is true?**
* **Answer: C. There is no private cause of action and no enforcement authority for State Attorneys General.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This is a strict federal criminal statute. Individuals cannot sue (no PRA). Interestingly, State AGs also lack specific enforcement authority under this federal rule (unlike HIPAA).
    * **Why not others:** No PRA (A). AGs enforce HIPAA, not Part 2 (B).

**72. To which of the following does the CAN-SPAM Act apply?**
* **Answer: B. Any "sender" of a commercial email with the primary purpose of advertising goods or services, directed to or sent from the U.S.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** CAN-SPAM applies to **commercial** electronic mail messages. The "primary purpose" test determines if a message is commercial (advertising) or transactional.
    * **Why not others:** It covers all commercial email, not just explicit material. Non-profits (A) and personal emails (D) are generally exempt or not considered "commercial."

**73. How does CAN-SPAM distinguish between "commercial" and "transactional or relationship" messages?**
* **Answer: B. Commercial messages must follow all rules (opt-out, identification), while transactional messages are mostly exempt except for header accuracy.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** **Transactional** messages (like shipping notifications, password resets) are exempt from the opt-out and physical address requirements. They only need to ensure the **header information** (To, From, Subject) is not misleading. Commercial messages must follow all rules.
    * **Why not others:** Transactional messages are definitely permitted (A) and do not require opt-in (D).

**74. Under the substantive rules for commercial emails, what is the maximum timeframe a sender has to honor a recipient’s opt-out request?**
* **Answer: B. 10 business days.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Senders must process opt-out requests within **10 business days**.
    * **Why not others:** 30 days (C) is the limit for how long the opt-out mechanism must remain *available* (active) for the user to click, not the processing time.

**75. What is the specific requirement for sending "Mobile Service Commercial Messages" (MSCMs) to wireless devices?**
* **Answer: B. They require "express prior authorization" (opt-in) from the recipient.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Unlike standard email (which is Opt-Out), commercial messages sent to wireless domains (MSCMs) generally require **Opt-In** (Express Prior Authorization) to prevent consumers from paying for data charges for spam.
    * **Why not others:** It flips the standard rule (A).

**76. Which agency is the primary federal enforcer of the CAN-SPAM Act, and what are the potential penalties?**
* **Answer: B. The FTC; with civil penalties of up to approximately $53,088 per violation.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The **FTC** is the primary enforcer. Within the last few years, the civil penalty maximum was adjusted for inflation to approximately ~$51k-$53k (historically $40k initially).
    * **Why not others:** It is not a criminal statute (A/C) primarily, though the DOJ can enforce criminal sanctions for egregious fraud. FCC (A) shares some jurisdiction (common carriers) but FTC is the primary named agency for general business.

**77. Regarding legal remedies, who has a private right of action to sue under the CAN-SPAM Act?**
* **Answer: C. Internet Access Service (IAS) providers who are adversely affected by violations.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This is a crucial distinction. **Consumers** (A) have NO private right of action. However, **ISPs** (like Google, Comcast) CAN sue spammers who clog their networks.
    * **Why not others:** State Governors/AGs (B) can sue, but the question asks about *private* rights, or implies a distinction between government and private entities. ISPs are the only private entities with standing.

**78. Who is considered a "covered entity" under CISA for the purposes of sharing and receiving cybersecurity information?**
* **Answer: B. The federal government and "non-Federal entities," which include state/local governments and private entities.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** CISA is designed to facilitate two-way information sharing between the **Federal Government** and **Non-Federal Entities** (private companies, state/local/tribal governments).
    * **Why not others:** It is not limited to specific industries (C) or just the intelligence community (A).

**79. How does CISA define "cyberthreat indicators"?**
* **Answer: B. Information necessary to describe or identify malicious reconnaissance, methods of intrusion, or exploitation techniques.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This mirrors the statutory definition. Indicators capture the technical "how" of an attack (malware signatures, IP addresses, phishing patterns) rather than the "who" (personal habits).
    * **Why not others:** It notably excludes personal info about the hacker's habits (A) if unrelated to the threat mechanics.

**80. Under the substantive rules of CISA, what is the nature of the information-sharing requirements for private companies?**
* **Answer: C. Sharing is entirely voluntary, and the Act imposes no affirmative disclosure obligations.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** CISA is a **voluntary** framework. It encourages sharing by offering liability protection, but it does NOT mandate that any private company share anything (unlike breach notification laws).
    * **Why not others:** It is never mandatory (A/D).

**81. What privacy protection step must an entity take *before* sharing a cyberthreat indicator with the government under CISA?**
* **Answer: C. They must use their technical capability to scrub any personal information (PII) of specific individuals not relevant to the threat.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This is the primary privacy safeguard. Entities must review indicators and remove (scrub) any PII that is not directly necessary to understand the cyber threat.
    * **Why not others:** Judicial orders (A) are not required for this voluntary sharing. Notification (B) is not required.

**82. Regarding legal liability, what protection does CISA provide to entities that share information in accordance with its protocols?**
* **Answer: B. It grants broad immunity from civil and criminal liability for monitoring systems and sharing threat intelligence.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** To encourage participation, CISA provides **liability protection** (immunity) to companies. They cannot be sued for monitoring their own networks or for sharing indicators with the DHS/government, provided they follow the rules (like scrubbing PII).
    * **Why not others:** It does not protect against FTC enforcement for *other* failures (C) (like failing to secure data), only for the act of sharing.

**83. Which of the following is a key restriction on the federal government’s use of information received under CISA?**
* **Answer: C. The information cannot be used by the government for regulatory enforcement actions (such as antitrust) unrelated to cybersecurity.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This is a compromise to get businesses to trust the government. The data shared for security cannot be used by regulators (like the FTC or DOJ Antitrust Division) to punish the company for unrelated regulatory matters.
    * **Why not others:** The data is specifically EXEMPT from FOIA (B) (public disclosure).

**84. Who is considered a "covered person" subject to the requirements of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act?**
* **Answer: B. Any person offering or providing a consumer financial product or service, or an affiliate doing the same.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Title X applies broadly to any "covered person" who provides a financial product/service to a consumer (lenders, debt collectors, servicers), regardless of size.
    * **Why not others:** The $10B threshold (A) determines whether the CFPB supervises them *directly* versus a smaller regulator, but the *law* applies to all. It covers more than just Reserve service providers (D).

**85. Title X prohibits "UDAAP" violations. What does this acronym stand for in the context of consumer financial protection?**
* **Answer: C. Unfair, Deceptive, and Abusive Acts or Practices.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Dodd-Frank added the term **"Abusive"** to the existing FTC standard of "Unfair" and "Deceptive." This created the new **UDAAP** standard.
    * **Why not others:** "Arbitrary" (A) and "Unlawful" (B) are not the correct terms in this specific acronym.

**86. Under the Act's "abusive" standard, an act or practice is prohibited if it takes "unreasonable advantage" of a consumer’s:**
* **Answer: A. Lack of understanding regarding the risks, costs, or conditions of a product.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** The statute specifically defines "abusive" as materially interfering with a consumer's ability to understand a term OR taking unreasonable advantage of their (1) **lack of understanding**, (2) inability to protect their interests, or (3) reasonable reliance on the covered person.
    * **Why not others:** Inability to pay (B) might be an underwriting issue, but "lack of understanding" is the specific trigger for the *abusive* standard.

**87. Which agency has broad federal enforcement authority over Dodd-Frank Title X and can seek civil penalties of over $1 million per day for knowing violations?**
* **Answer: C. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Dodd-Frank created the **CFPB** specifically to be this regulator. It has massive penalty authority (tiered penalties: approx $5k/day, $25k/day, or $1M+/day for knowing violations, adjusted for inflation).
    * **Why not others:** The FTC (A) shares some jurisdiction but the CFPB is the primary Title X enforcer.

**88. Regarding legal remedies for individuals, which of the following is true of Dodd-Frank Title X?**
* **Answer: C. It does not provide for a private cause of action.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Similar to the FTC Act, there is generally **no private right of action** for individuals to sue under the federal UDAAP standard of Title X. Enforcement is administrative (CFPB) or via State AGs.
    * **Why not others:** Consumers can sue under *other* laws (like FCRA or TILA), but not generally for a standalone Title X UDAAP violation.

**89. How are State Attorneys General involved in the enforcement of the Consumer Financial Protection Act?**
* **Answer: B. They may bring civil actions to enforce the Act, but must provide notice to federal authorities before filing suit.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Dodd-Frank explicitly empowers **State Attorneys General** to enforce its provisions (Title X) in federal or state court. They generally must consult with or notify the CFPB before filing.
    * **Why not others:** They are definitely not prohibited (A). They do not have *exclusive* authority (C).

**90. Who is considered a "covered entity" required to comply with the DPPA’s disclosure restrictions?**
* **Answer: B. State Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVs) and any of their officers, employees, or contractors.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The DPPA is a federal statute regulating **State DMVs**. It prohibits them from knowingly disclosing personal information from motor vehicle records.
    * **Why not others:** While insurance companies (C) receive data, the compliance burden of *not disclosing* starts with the DMV.

**91. What does the DPPA specifically protect as "personal information"?**
* **Answer: B. Information obtained by a DMV in connection with a motor vehicle record, such as a license number or address.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the standard definition: name, address, phone number, SSN, driver ID, photograph, medical info.
    * **Why not others:** The DPPA explicitly **EXCLUDES** information about **accidents**, driving violations, and legal status (A/D). This public safety data is considered public record.

**92. Under the DPPA, which of the following is classified as "Highly Restricted Personal Information" requiring express consent for most permissible uses?**
* **Answer: B. A person's photograph, Social Security Number, and medical/disability information.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The law creates a two-tier system. "Highly Restricted" PI (Photo, SSN, Medical) requires express consent (Opt-In) for almost any disclosure other than strict government/legal use.
    * **Why not others:** Addresses (A) are standard "Personal Information," not "Highly Restricted."

**93. According to the substantive rules, when is a DMV permitted to disclose personal information for marketing purposes?**
* **Answer: C. Only if the individual has provided express "opt-in" consent.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Originally, the law allowed an Opt-Out. A court case (*Reno*) and subsequent amendment changed this. Now, for survey/marketing/solicitation purposes, the DMV must obtain **express consent (Opt-In)**.
    * **Why not others:** Opt-Out (B) is no longer the standard for marketing.

**94. Which official has the authority to enforce the DPPA at the federal level, and what is a potential penalty for a noncompliant DMV?**
* **Answer: B. The U.S. Attorney General; civil penalties of up to $5,000 per day for substantial noncompliance.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The **U.S. Attorney General** (DOJ) enforces the Act against State DMVs. The fine for a DMV in substantial noncompliance is up to **$5,000 per day**.
    * **Why not others:** It is not an FTC (A) or Transportation (C) matter.

**95. Regarding legal remedies, what is true about the private cause of action provided by the DPPA?**
* **Answer: B. Individuals can sue for actual damages, but the law sets a floor of $2,500 in liquidated damages.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The DPPA provides a private right of action against any person who knowingly obtains or discloses data for an impermissible use. The plaintiff gets actual damages, but if actual damages are low, they automatically get **$2,500 liquidated damages** (plus attorney's fees).
    * **Why not others:** No financial loss floor (C) is required. Punitive damages are also allowed (refuting D).

**96. Under the FCRA, which entity is primarily responsible for compiling consumer information to provide "consumer reports" to third parties for a fee?**
* **Answer: C. Consumer Reporting Agencies (CRAs).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The **CRA** (like Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) is the regulated entity that compiles and sells the data.
    * **Why not others:** *Furnishers* (A) (like banks) give data to CRAs. *Users* (B) (like lenders/landlords) buy data from CRAs.

**97. How does the FCRA define an "Investigative Consumer Report" compared to a standard consumer report?**
* **Answer: B. It includes information about a consumer’s character or reputation obtained through personal interviews.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is a key FCRA distinction. If the report involves gathering subjective info (character, reputation, lifestyle) via **interviews** with neighbors/associates (often for employment or insurance), it is "Investigative" and requires special notice (within 3 days).
    * **Why not others:** Standard credit reports (A) are objective data, not investigative.

**98. When a "user" takes an adverse action (such as denying credit or employment) based on a consumer report, what is their primary obligation?**
* **Answer: A. They must provide the consumer with an "Adverse Action Notice".**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** The user must tell the consumer *why* they were denied. This notice must include the name of the CRA, notice of the right to obtain a free copy of the report, and the right to dispute accuracy.
    * **Why not others:** No fee is paid to the CFPB (B).

**99. The "Red Flags Rule," added by FACTA, requires financial institutions and certain creditors to:**
* **Answer: B. Implement a written program to identify, detect, and mitigate patterns of identity theft.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** FACTA (Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, amending FCRA) mandated the **Red Flags Rule**. It specifically targets **identity theft** prevention by requiring written Identity Theft Prevention Programs.
    * **Why not others:** Reporting cash >$10k is part of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), not FACTA.

**100. According to the Supreme Court’s ruling in *TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez*, what must a plaintiff demonstrate to have standing to sue for an FCRA violation in federal court?**
* **Answer: C. An actual, "concrete harm" resulting from the violation.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This recent (2021) landmark case limited class actions. The Court ruled that a plaintiff cannot sue just because a company failed to follow a procedure (A) (statutory violation); the plaintiff must prove they suffered **actual, concrete harm** (e.g., reputational damage because the inaccurate file was actually sent to a third party).

**101. Which two federal agencies share the primary responsibility for enforcing the FCRA and its implementing regulations (like Regulation V)?**
* **Answer: B. The FTC and the CFPB.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The **FTC** was the original enforcer. Dodd-Frank transferred rulemaking authority (Regulation V) to the **CFPB**, but both agencies retain enforcement power over different entities (CFPB over large banks; FTC over smaller entities/general businesses).
    * **Why not others:** FCC (A) handles telecoms; SEC (C) handles securities.

**102. Who is primarily considered a "covered entity" required to comply with FERPA’s privacy mandates?**
* **Answer: B. Any educational agency or institution that receives funds under any program administered by the U.S. Department of Education.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** FERPA's authority comes from the Spending Clause. If a school receives explicit federal funding from the Dept of Ed (which effectively all public K-12 and most public/private universities do), they must comply.
    * **Why not others:** Private schools that accept NO federal funding (A) are not covered.

**103. FERPA protects "education records," which are defined as records that are maintained by an educational institution and:**
* **Answer: B. Relate directly to a student.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The definition of "Education Record" has three parts: (1) Directly related to a student, (2) Maintained by the agency/institution.
    * **Why not others:** It excludes "sole possession" notes (C) (memory aids) and peer-graded papers (D) before they are recorded by the teacher.

**104. Under the substantive rules of FERPA, what is the maximum timeframe an educational institution has to comply with a request for access to education records?**
* **Answer: C. 45 days.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Schools must provide access to records within **45 days** of the request.
    * **Why not others:** This is longer than the typical GDPR/CCPA active response times (often 30 days) but is the specific statutory window for FERPA.

**105. How does FERPA generally handle the privacy of health records held by an educational institution (such as school nurse records)?**
* **Answer: B. They are subject to FERPA and are generally excluded from the HIPAA Privacy Rule.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is a common overlap question. Health records maintained by a FERPA covered entity (like a school nurse) are considered "Education Records" and are governed by **FERPA**, not HIPAA. The HIPAA Privacy Rule explicitly excludes education records covered by FERPA to avoid dual regulation.
    * **Why not others:** They are NOT under HIPAA (A).

**106. Which agency or office is responsible for the federal administrative enforcement of FERPA?**
* **Answer: B. The Department of Education’s Office of the Chief Privacy Officer (formerly the Family Policy Compliance Office).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Enforcement is handled within the **Department of Education**. The specific office has evolved (formerly FPCO), but it is definitely an Ed Dept function.
    * **Why not others:** It is not an FTC (A) or HHS (C) matter.

**107. Regarding legal remedies for individual students or parents, which of the following is true?**
* **Answer: C. It does not provide for a private cause of action.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The Supreme Court ruled in *Gonzaga University v. Doe* that FERPA creates spending conditions, not individual rights enforceable in court. Therefore, students/parents cannot sue. The remedy is filing a complaint with the Dept of Ed, which can (theoretically) cut off funding.
    * **Why not others:** No PRA (A/B).

**108. Who is the primary target of surveillance authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)?**
* **Answer: B. Foreign powers or agents of a foreign power.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** FISA was enacted to regulate surveillance of "foreign power" and "agents of a foreign power" within the U.S.
    * **Why not others:** It is not for general criminal suspects (A); for that, the government uses Title III (the Wiretap Act). "Agents" can include U.S. citizens (refuting C) if they are spying for a foreign nation.

**109. To obtain an order for electronic surveillance, the government must show that gathering foreign intelligence is a:**
* **Answer: C. "Significant purpose".**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Originally, foreign intelligence had to be the "primary purpose." The **USA PATRIOT Act** changed this standard to "significant purpose," making it easier for law enforcement to use FISA tools where there is overlapping criminal interest.
    * **Why not others:** "Primary" (B) was the old standard. "Sole" (A) was never the standard.

**110. What authority is granted to the government under FISA Section 215?**
* **Answer: A. The production of "any tangible thing" relevant to an authorized investigation.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** Section 215 (the "Business Records" provision) allows the FBI to order the production of "any tangible things" (books, records, papers, documents). This was the controversial authority used for bulk metadata collection (until reform).
    * **Why not others:** Wiring/Decryption (B/D) fall under different sections or laws (like CALEA or traditional warrants).

**111. Under FISA Section 702, the government is authorized to conduct surveillance on which of the following groups?**
* **Answer: B. Non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Section 702 authorizes targeting **non-U.S. persons outside the U.S.** to acquire foreign intelligence information.
    * **Why not others:** It cannot intentionally target U.S. citizens (A) or anyone inside the U.S. (regardless of citizenship).

**112. What requirement must the government follow to limit the amount of information obtained and retained about "United States persons"?**
* **Answer: B. Minimization Procedures.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** FISA strictly requires **Minimization Procedures**. These are specific rules adopted by the AG to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of non-publicly available information concerning unconsenting U.S. persons.
    * **Why not others:** "Deletion Protocols" (C) is a descriptive term, but "Minimization Procedures" is the legal term of art.

**113. Regarding legal remedies, what statutory damages can an individual seek in a private cause of action for a FISA violation?**
* **Answer: C. $100 per day or $1,000, whichever is greater.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Unlike many other intelligence laws (or lack thereof), FISA *does* provide a private right of action for illegal surveillance. The statutory damages are actual damages, or $100/day for each day of violation, or $1,000, whichever is higher (plus punitive damages/attorney's fees).
    * **Why not others:** It creates specific liability for "agents of foreign power" or federal officers who violate the law.

**114. Which of the following represents the correct chronological order of enactment for these major surveillance laws?**
* **Answer: B. FISA -> USA PATRIOT Act -> USA FREEDOM Act.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:**
        1.  **FISA (1978):** Created the foundation/FISC.
        2.  **USA PATRIOT Act (2001):** Expanded powers (Section 215) after 9/11.
        3.  **USA FREEDOM Act (2015):** Reforming/restricting bulk collection after Snowden leaks.

**115. Which law was enacted in 1978 to create a specialized court (the FISC) and establish a legal framework for foreign intelligence surveillance?**
* **Answer: C. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** FISA (1978) was passed in response to abuses of domestic surveillance (Watergate era). It established the **Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)**.
    * **Why not others:** ECPA (B) was 1986. PATRIOT (A) was 2001.

**116. Which 2015 legislation amended prior authorities to end the bulk collection of telephone metadata and introduced amicus curiae experts to the FISC?**
* **Answer: B. The USA FREEDOM Act.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The **USA FREEDOM Act (2015)** ended the bulk collection of call detail records under Section 215 and created a panel of "amicus curiae" (friends of the court) to advise the FISC on privacy and civil liberties.
    * **Why not others:** CLOUD Act (C) (2018) deals with cross-border data access.

**117. Which act significantly lowered the legal threshold for surveillance by changing the requirement that foreign intelligence be the "primary purpose" of a search to a "significant purpose"?**
* **Answer: B. The USA PATRIOT Act.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The **USA PATRIOT Act** (2001) amended FISA to break down the "wall" between criminal and intelligence investigations. It changed the "primary purpose" requirement to **"significant purpose,"** allowing more flexibility for law enforcement.
    * **Why not others:** FREEDOM Act (C) was restrictive/reformative.

**118. Who is considered a "covered entity" subject to the FTC’s Section 5 authority?**
* **Answer: A. Any business or individual engaging in “practices in or affecting commerce.”**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** The FTC has broad jurisdiction over nearly all commercial entities in the U.S. that engage in commerce.
    * **Why not others:** It excludes government agencies (D) (sovereign immunity) and is not limited to large/pledged companies (B/C).

**119. Which of the following groups is explicitly EXEMPT from the FTC’s Section 5 authority?**
* **Answer: B. Non-profit entities, banking institutions, and common carriers.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** These are the three major "carve-outs." Banks are regulated by banking agencies (OCC, Fed, FDIC). Common carriers (telecom/transport) by FCC/DOT. Non-profits are generally exempt unless they are actually for-profit shams.
    * **Why not others:** Private healthcare providers (A) are covered (though HIPAA also applies, FTC can still enforce). Foreign corps (D) are covered if they touch U.S. commerce.

**120. Under the "deceptive" trade practice standard, a statement or omission must be "material," meaning it is:**
* **Answer: B. Likely to affect a consumer’s conduct or decision.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the legal definition of **materiality**. If the lie wouldn't change your mind about buying the product, it's not "material" deception.
    * **Why not others:** It doesn't need to be written (A) or intentional (C) (FTC is strict liability—intent doesn't matter for the initial violation finding).

**121. To be considered "unfair" under Section 5(n), a trade practice must cause a substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers and is:**
* **Answer: A. Not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** This is the **three-part test** for Unfairness codified in Section 5(n): (1) Substantial Injury, (2) Not reasonably avoidable, (3) Not outweighed by benefits.
    * **Why not others:** Intent (C) is irrelevant. Misleading statements (B) related to *Deception*, not Unfairness.

**122. Under the Magnuson-Moss Act (Section 18), the FTC can only issue rules regarding unfair or deceptive practices if it has reason to believe those practices are:**
* **Answer: B. "Prevalent," established via prior orders or a widespread pattern of conduct.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The FTC cannot just make rules on a whim. Under Mag-Moss, they must show the practice is **"prevalent"** (widespread) to justify industry-wide regulation.
    * **Why not others:** Criminal history (A) or specific percentages (C) are not the standard.

**123. When the FTC initiates a formal enforcement action, where is the matter first heard?**
* **Answer: C. Before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Formal administrative complaints go to an **ALJ** (unless the FTC files directly in federal court for an injunction). The ALJ holds a mini-trial.
    * **Why not others:** It does not go straight to the full Commission (D) or a District Court (B) for the *initial* administrative hearing (though the FTC *can* choose federal court for certain remedies).

**124. If a company wishes to appeal a final adverse determination by the full FTC Commission, where must the appeal be filed?**
* **Answer: B. A federal Circuit Court of Appeal.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Appeals from federal agencies go up to the **Circuit Court of Appeals** (appellate level), skipping the District Court district trial level.
    * **Why not others:** Not District Court (A). Supreme Court (C) is too high (requires certiorari later).

**125. Regarding civil penalties, what is true about the FTC's authority under the Act?**
* **Answer: B. The FTC can only seek civil penalties in federal court, not through administrative hearings.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The FTC generally lacks authority to impose civil monetary penalties (fines) in its own administrative courts (unlike the CFPB). To get $$ fines, it must go to **Federal Court** (often for violating a previous order or a specific rule like COPPA). *AMG Capital* further restricted their ability to get equitable monetary relief (disgorgement) under 13(b).
    * **Why not others:** The ALJ cannot impose fines (A).

**126. Does Section 5 of the FTC Act provide for a private right of action?**
* **Answer: C. No, only the government can bring suits under the FTC Act.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** There is **NO private right of action** under the FTC Act. You cannot sue a company for "Unfair/Deceptive Acts" under federal law (though you might be able to under state "Little FTC Acts").
    * **Why not others:** A/B are false.

**127. Which landmark judicial decision affirmed the FTC's authority to regulate cybersecurity failures as an "unfair" trade practice?**
* **Answer: B. *FTC v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp.***
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** In *Wyndham*, the 3rd Circuit affirmed that lax cybersecurity can be "unfair" even if there was no specific deception/promise. It cemented the FTC's role as the primary cyber-regulator.
    * **Why not others:** *LabMD* (C) was a win for the other side (regarding specific order strictness). *AMG* (A) limited monetary powers.

**128. Who is considered a "covered entity" subject to the requirements of Title II of GINA?**
* **Answer: C. Employers, employment agencies, labor unions, and training programs.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Title II of GINA prohibits discrimination in employment. It applies to arguably all sectors of employment: employers (private state/local govt), unions, and training programs. (Note: Title I covers Health Insurance).
    * **Why not others:** It's not limited to healthcare (A) or the federal govt (D).

**129. How does GINA define "Genetic Information" regarding an individual?**
* **Answer: B. Information about an individual's current medical symptoms and diagnosis.** (Correction: The statutory definition is B's text "genetic tests, family members...", A distracts with "current symptoms").  
* **Answer: B. Information about an individual's genetic tests, those of family members, and the manifestation of disease in family members.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** GINA is very specific. It covers **genetic tests** and **family medical history**. Crucially, it does NOT cover the *current manifestation* of a disease in the employee themselves (that is an ADA issue, not GINA). However, the manifestation of disease in *family members* counts as "genetic information" (family history).
    * **Why not others:** It excludes current symptoms (A).

**130. Under GINA's substantive rules, what is an employer generally prohibited from doing with respect to genetic information?**
* **Answer: B. Using it as a basis for hiring, firing, or promotion decisions.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the core prohibition: No discrimination based on genetic info.
    * **Why not others:** Storing it is allowed (if kept separate, unlike A). Sharing it is strictly limited (C is generally wrong unless a specific exception applies).

**131. GINA prohibits covered entities from "requesting, requiring, or purchasing" genetic information. Which of the following is a primary exception to this rule?**
* **Answer: B. When the acquisition of the information is "inadvertent" (e.g., overhearing a conversation).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the "Water Cooler Exception." If a manager overhears an employee talking about their mom's cancer, it's not a violation because it was **inadvertent**.
    * **Why not others:** Productivity (C) is not a valid reason.

**132. What is the specific requirement for an employer to legally acquire genetic information as part of a voluntary wellness program?**
* **Answer: C. Participation must be voluntary and the employer must obtain prior "written authorization".**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Wellness programs are a major exception. Employers CAN ask for family history (HRA) if the employee provides **voluntary, written authorization**.
    * **Why not others:** Inducements (A) are highly regulated/restricted under recent EEOC rules to ensure voluntariness.

**133. An employer is permitted to purchase genetic information about an employee if that information is:**
* **Answer: B. "Commercially or publicly available," such as in a newspaper or on a public website.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the "Newspaper Exception." If the info is in a newspaper, magazine, or publicly available book, the employer didn't "request" it illegally.
    * **Why not others:** Data brokers (A) are not an exception.

**134. Under which federal statute's compliance requirements is an employer permitted to request genetic information?**
* **Answer: C. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** If an employee asks for FMLA leave to care for a sick family member, the employer *must* ask for medical certification (which includes family history). GINA permits this receipt of info.
    * **Why not others:** FLSA/OSHA do not inherently require family history in the same way.

**135. Which federal agency is responsible for the administrative enforcement of GINA Title II?**
* **Answer: C. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The **EEOC** enforces Title II (Employment). (HHS/Labor/Treasury enforce Title I - Health Insurance).
    * **Why not others:** Not FTC (A).

**136. Regarding legal remedies, how is GINA Title II enforced through the courts?**
* **Answer: B. It permits a private cause of action in the same way as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** GINA piggybacks on Title VII remedies. You file an EEOC charge, get a "Right to Sue" letter, and then sue in federal court for damages (reinstatement, back pay, compensatory/punitive damages).
    * **Why not others:** It *does* have a PRA (refuting A).

**137. How does GINA Title II interact with the HIPAA Privacy Rule?**
* **Answer: B. Genetic information is explicitly classified as "Protected Health Information" (PHI) under HIPAA.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** One of GINA's mandates was to modify HIPAA to explicitly state that **genetic information IS health information (PHI)** and thus protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
    * **Why not others:** It doesn't replace HIPAA (A). GINA actually prohibits storing it with general personnel files (implying D is wrong; it must be kept confidential/separate).

**138. Who is considered a "covered entity" subject to the requirements of the GLBA?**
* **Answer: B. Any "financial institution" significantly engaged in financial activities, including "finders" who connect consumers with lenders.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** GLBA applies to "financial institutions," defined broadly as any company significantly engaged in "financial activities" (lending, insuring, advising). The "finders" rule expanded this even further to those who just bring buyers/sellers together.
    * **Why not others:** It is NOT limited to banks size (A) or govt agencies (D).

**139. The GLBA applies to "Nonpublic Personal Information" (NPI). Which of the following is generally EXCLUDED from this definition?**
* **Answer: C. Publicly available information or lists created without using nonpublic information.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** NPI strictly excludes **publicly available** information (like real estate records or phone book listings).
    * **Why not others:** Transaction history (B) and Account info (D) are classic NPI.

**140. Under the GLBA Privacy Rule, when is a financial institution required to provide a consumer with a "short-form" notice rather than a full initial notice?**
* **Answer: B. When the individual is a one-time "consumer" (e.g., using an ATM) and the institution shares their NPI with non-affiliated third parties.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the distinction between **Consumer** (one-off) and **Customer** (ongoing relationship). Customers get the full annual notice. Consumers only get a "Short Form" notice IF the bank shares their data. If the bank doesn't share consumer data, no notice is required for one-off transactions (like buying a money order or using an ATM).
    * **Why not others:** Mortgages (A) are "Customers" (full notice).

**141. Financial institutions must provide consumers an opportunity to "opt-out" of sharing their NPI with:**
* **Answer: C. Non-affiliated third parties.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This is the core GLBA Privacy Rule right. You can Opt-Out of sharing with **Non-Affiliates**.
    * **Why not others:** You generally CANNOT opt-out of sharing with Affiliates (A) (FCRA regulates that, but it's an Opt-Out, GLBA is stricter on non-affiliates). You definitely can't opt-out of necessary service providers (B) or law enforcement (D).

**142. Which of the following is a mandatory requirement for a written "Comprehensive Information Security Program" under the GLBA Safeguards Rule?**
* **Answer: A. Designating a single "Qualified Individual" to oversee and enforce the security program.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** The 2021 update to the Safeguards Rule explicitly requires designating a **single Qualified Individual** (CISO equivalent, though can be external) to be responsible for the program.
    * **Why not others:** Encryption must be for transit AND rest (refuting C).

**143. Regarding enforcement and legal remedies, which of the following is true of the GLBA?**
* **Answer: B. It is enforced by prudential financial regulators, the FTC, and the CFPB, but lacks a federal private cause of action.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Enforcement is split among federal banking regulators (OCC, Fed), the CFPB (Rulemaking/Privacy), and the FTC (Safeguards/Privacy for non-banks). Crucially, there is **NO Private Right of Action**.
    * **Why not others:** No PRA (A). AGs can enforce state equivalents (refuting C).

**144. Which of the following is considered a "covered entity" required to comply with HIPAA's Privacy and Security Rules?**
* **Answer: B. Health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers who transmit health information in electronic form.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the standard definition of a "Covered Entity" (CE). It includes plans (insurers), clearinghouses, and providers (doctors/hospitals) who engage in electronic billing/transactions.
    * **Why not others:** Employers (A) are generally NOT covered entities (unless they self-insure, but even then it's the Plan, not the employer as a whole). Individuals (D) are not covered.

**145. How does the HIPAA Security Rule categorize its implementation specifications for electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)?**
* **Answer: B. As "Required" (must be implemented) or "Addressable" (must be assessed for reasonableness).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The Security Rule is flexible/scalable. "Required" specs must be done. "Addressable" specs must be assessed; if reasonable/appropriate, you do it. If not, you document why and implement an alternative equivalent measure.
    * **Why not others:** There is no "Recommended" or "Optional" category (A). It definitely has a Physical component (locks, guards) (refuting C).

**146. Under the HITECH Act amendments, what is the default standard for determining if an unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI constitutes a "breach"?**
* **Answer: A. A breach is presumed unless the entity demonstrates a "low probability" that the PHI was compromised based on a four-factor risk assessment.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** Originally, the "harm standard" applied (only a breach if it caused harm). HITECH/Omnibus Rule changed this to the **"Low Probability of Compromise"** standard. You must assume it's a breach unless you can prove (via risk assessment) that it wasn't compromised.
    * **Why not others:** "Harm" is no longer the test.

**147. When a covered entity discovers a breach of PHI, what is the maximum timeframe permitted for notifying affected individuals?**
* **Answer: C. Without unreasonable delay and no later than 60 days after discovery.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The statutory clock is **60 calendar days**. Note: "Without unreasonable delay" is the primary rule; 60 days is just the outer limit.
    * **Why not others:** 30 days (B) is the GDPR/State standard often, but HIPAA allows 60.

**148. Which of the following describes the federal administrative enforcement structure for HIPAA violations?**
* **Answer: A. HHS enforces compliance through investigations and civil penalties, while the DOJ can bring criminal prosecutions.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** **HHS (OCR)** handles civil enforcement (CMP). The **DOJ** handles criminal prosecutions for knowing misuse (up to 10 years in prison).
    * **Why not others:** FTC (B) can enforce privacy promises under Section 5, but they don't have *exclusive* or primary HIPAA authority (though they share jurisdiction in practice for data security).

**149. Regarding legal remedies for individuals, which of the following is true of HIPAA?**
* **Answer: B. It does not provide for a federal private cause of action.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** There is **NO Private Right of Action** under HIPAA. You cannot sue your doctor in federal court strictly for a HIPAA violation. (You might sue for state law negligence/privacy torts using HIPAA as the standard of care, but that's a state claim).
    * **Why not others:** A is false.

**150. Who is primarily regulated by the Junk Fax Protection Act, and what is the specific medium of communication it covers?**
* **Answer: B. Any person sending "unsolicited advertisements" via facsimile (fax) transmissions.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** As the name implies, it regulates **FAXES**. Specifically, unsolicited advertisements sent by fax. It codified the FCC's EBR exception for faxes.
    * **Why not others:** Not texts (A) or emails (C).

**151. Under the "Established Business Relationship" (EBR) exception, a sender may legally send a commercial fax if they obtained the recipient’s number through voluntary communication or public distribution, provided they ALSO:**
* **Answer: B. Include a clear and conspicuous notice on the first page explaining the recipient's right to opt-out.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Even if you have an EBR (prior business), you MUST include an **Opt-Out Notice** on the first page of the fax. If you don't include the notice, the fax is illegal.
    * **Why not others:** The fee (C) is not a requirement.

**152. Regarding legal remedies, which of the following is true about the private cause of action provided by the JFPA?**
* **Answer: B. Individuals can sue for statutory damages of up to $500 per fax, which can be trebled for willful violations.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Since the JFPA is an amendment to the TCPA, it shares the same penalty structure: Private Right of Action for **$500 per violation** (per fax), treble damages ($1500) for willful/knowing violations.
    * **Why not others:** It *does* have a PRA (refuting A).

**153. What is the primary distinction between a "pen register" and a "trap and trace device" under the statute?**
* **Answer: B. A pen register decodes outgoing dialing and routing information, while a trap and trace identifies the originating source of incoming communications.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the core definition. **Pen Register** = Outgoing numbers dialed *by* the target. **Trap and Trace** = Incoming numbers dialing *to* the target. Both capture dialing/routing metadata.
    * **Why not others:** A has them backward. Neither collects content (C).

**154. To obtain a court order for the installation of these devices, the government must certify to a judge that the information likely to be obtained is:**
* **Answer: B. "Relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation."**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Collects metadata, not content, so the standard is low: just **"relevant to an investigation."** Most importantly, if the government certifies relevance, the judge **MUST** issue the order; they have no discretion to deny it.
    * **Why not others:** It requires neither Probable Cause (A) nor Reasonable Suspicion (C).

**155. Which of the following is a "Crucial Distinction" regarding the type of data these devices are permitted to collect?**
* **Answer: B. They are strictly prohibited from collecting the "content" of the communication.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** These devices are for addressing/routing info only (phone numbers, IP headers, email To/From). They CANNOT record the "content" (audio, body of email).
    * **Why not others:** Subject lines (C) are often considered content in email contexts (unlike phone numbers), so they are generally excluded too. First 30 seconds (A) is content.

**156. Under the Act’s emergency exception (e.g., danger to life or national security), law enforcement may install a device without a prior order provided they seek one within what timeframe?**
* **Answer: B. 48 hours.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The statute allows immediate installation in emergencies (immediate danger of death/injury, national security threats), but a retroactive order must be sought within **48 hours**.
    * **Why not others:** 72 hours (C) is standard for some other FISA/Title III provisions, but Pen/Trap is 48.

**157. How is a violation of this statute enforced at the federal level?**
* **Answer: A. It is a criminal offense punishable by fines and up to one year of imprisonment.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** Knowing violation of the statute is a federal crime (misdemeanor level, up to 1 year).
    * **Why not others:** Not an FTC matter (B).

**158. Regarding legal remedies and the private sector, which of the following is true?**
* **Answer: B. The statute provides immunity from civil liability to providers who cooperate with a valid court order.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** To ensure telecom providers help the police, the law grants them **immunity** from lawsuits if they provide assistance pursuant to a court order.
    * **Why not others:** There is generally **NO private right of action** for individuals under the Pen/Trap statute (unlike the Wiretap Act or Stored Communications Act, which do have PRAs). A is false.

**159. Who is primarily restricted by the Privacy Protection Act of 1980 regarding the search and seizure of journalistic materials?**
* **Answer: B. Officers and employees of both federal and state governments.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The PPA restricts "government officers or employees" at all levels (federal, state, and local) from searching/seizing materials from someone engaged in First Amendment activities (journalists/publishers).
    * **Why not others:** It does not apply to private actors (A). It applies to MORE than just feds (C).

**160. The Act protects "work product material" and "documentary material." How do these categories differ under the law?**
* **Answer: A. Work product material is created by the journalist; documentary material is main source material obtained from others.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** "Work Product" = the journalist's own notes, drafts, and mental impressions. "Documentary Material" = raw materials provided by sources (photos, recordings, documents). The PPA gives HIGHER protection to Work Product (fewer warrant exceptions).
    * **Why not others:** Both are protected from warrants, but Work Product is harder to get (refuting B).

**161. Under the substantive rules of the PPA, what is the standard requirement for the government to obtain materials intended for public dissemination?**
* **Answer: B. The government must generally use a subpoena rather than a search warrant.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The core PPA rule is: **Subpoena First.** A subpoena allows the journalist to challenge the request in court before handing anything over. A warrant (surprise raid) is generally prohibited unless an exception applies.
    * **Why not others:** A warrant (A) is the *exception*, not the rule.

**162. In which of the following scenarios is the government PERMITTED to use a search warrant to seize protected materials?**
* **Answer: C. If there is reason to believe that the seizure is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This is the "Emergency Exception" (or Life and Limb exception). If someone is about to die, police can get a warrant to seize specific journalist materials (e.g., adequate warning of a planned bombing).
    * **Why not others:** Misdemeanors (B) aren't enough. The main "Criminality Exception" applies if the journalist *themselves* committed the crime (but NOT if the crime is just possessing the leaked docs).

**163. Which exception for using a search warrant applies ONLY to "documentary materials" and NOT to "work product"?**
* **Answer: C. If the person in possession has failed to comply with a court order and all appeals are exhausted.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The PPA splits exceptions.
        *   **Both** can be seized for: Criminal Suspect (Journalist did it) or Death/Injury.
        *   **Documentary ONLY** can be seized for: Destruction of Evidence (reason to believe they will destroy it) or **Failure to Comply with Subpoena** (after appeals).
    * **Why not others:** You generally can *never* get a warrant for "Work Product" just because they ignored a subpoena; the remedy is contempt of court, not a raid.

**164. Regarding legal remedies, what is the minimum amount of statutory damages a plaintiff can recover for a violation of the PPA?**
* **Answer: B. $1,000.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The PPA provides a statutory minimum of **$1,000** in liquidated damages against the government entity (or officer if the entity isn't liable).
    * **Why not others:** It's higher than the $100/day often seen in older laws, but specifically set at $1k.

**165. Who is considered a "covered entity" subject to the requirements of the PPRA?**
* **Answer: B. Only elementary and secondary schools that receive federal funding.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Unlike FERPA (which covers colleges), the PPRA applies specifically to **primary and secondary schools** (K-12) that receive Dept of Ed funding.
    * **Why not others:** It does NOT apply to post-secondary institutions (colleges/universities) (refuting A).

**166. Under the PPRA’s substantive rules, what must a school obtain before requiring a student to submit to a survey that would reveal sensitive information (such as political affiliations or mental problems)?**
* **Answer: C. Permission from the student's parent or guardian.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This is the core "Survey Rights" provision. If a federally funded survey asks about the "8 shielded categories" (politics, sex, religion, income, etc.), the school must get **parental consent**.
    * **Why not others:** The student cannot consent for themselves unless they are an adult (emancipated/18).

**167. Regarding enforcement and legal remedies, which of the following is true of the PPRA?**
* **Answer: B. It is enforced in a similar manner to FERPA and lacks a private cause of action.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Like FERPA, the PPRA is a spending clause statute enforced by the Dept of Ed (specifically the Student Privacy Policy Office). There is no individual right to sue.
    * **Why not others:** No PRA (A). Not FTC (C).

**168. Who is considered a "customer" whose financial records are protected from unauthorized federal access under the RFPA?**
* **Answer: B. Individuals and partnerships consisting of five or fewer people.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The RFPA was passed to protect **individuals**. It specifically limits the definition of "customer" to individuals or small partnerships (<5 people).
    * **Why not others:** It EXCLUDES corporations (A), large partnerships, and non-profits.

**169. Which entities are primarily restricted by the RFPA regarding the acquisition of financial records?**
* **Answer: C. Federal government agencies and their officers.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The RFPA was a response to *United States v. Miller* (Supreme Court case saying you have no 4th Amendment right in bank records). Congress passed RFPA to restrict the **Federal Government**.
    * **Why not others:** It does NOT apply to State/Local police (A), nor private actors (B).

**170. Before a financial institution is permitted to disclose records to a federal agency under the Act, what must the agency provide to the institution?**
* **Answer: B. A written certification that it has complied with the applicable provisions of the RFPA.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the bank's "Get Out of Jail Free" card. The bank cannot release the records until the government agency provides a **Certificate of Compliance**, stating they have followed all RFPA rules (e.g., notified the customer or got a valid warrant).
    * **Why not others:** Verbal assurance (A) is insufficient.

**171. Under the RFPA’s substantive rules, which of the following is a valid method for a federal agency to obtain financial records?**
* **Answer: B. A valid search warrant, which allows notice to the customer to be delayed for up to 90 days.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The government can use a Search Warrant. Unlike subpoenas (where the customer gets prior notice to challenge it), a Warrant allows the government to ask a judge to **delay notice** (usually 90 days) to avoid tipping off the suspect.
    * **Why not others:** Informal requests (A/C) are prohibited.

**172. What is the minimum amount of statutory damages a customer can recover in a private lawsuit for a violation of the RFPA?**
* **Answer: B. $100.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** RFPA provides for: Actual damages + Punitive damages + Attorney's fees + **$100 statutory damages** (regardless of the actual loss size).
    * **Why not others:** It's a small amount, but it exists (unlike D).

**173. Regarding legal remedies and enforcement, which of the following is true of the RFPA?**
* **Answer: B. It provides a private cause of action with a three-year statute of limitations.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Customers can sue the federal agency or the bank for violating the Act. The Statute of Limitations is **3 years**.
    * **Why not others:** It is not an administrative enforcement scheme like CFPB (A). It's a direct private right of action for the citizen.

**174. How does the SCA distinguish between an "Electronic Communication Service" (ECS) and a "Remote Computing Service" (RCS)?**
* **Answer: B. ECS provides the ability to send or receive communications; RCS provides computer storage or processing services to the public.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** These are the two distinct categories of providers. **ECS** = email/text/phone (transit). **RCS** = cloud storage/data processing (storage). The distinction matters for how easily the government can get access (though *Warshak* blurred this for email).
    * **Why not others:** It's not about hardware vs. software (A).

**175. Under the SCA, what constitutes "electronic storage" for a wire or electronic communication?**
* **Answer: B. Temporary, intermediate storage incidental to transmission, or storage for backup protection.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is a highly technical and litigated definition. The SCA protects "electronic storage," defined as (1) temporary intermediate storage (ECS queue) or (2) backup storage.
    * **Why not others:** It does NOT generally cover opened emails left on a server indefinitely (unless for backup), leading to the "180-day rule" confusion in older interpretations. It is not limited to encrypted data (C).

**176. What is the primary requirement for service providers regarding the preservation of evidence under the SCA?**
* **Answer: C. Upon government request, providers must preserve communications and records for 90 days, subject to renewal.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This is the "Freeze Letter." The government can ask a provider to **preserve** records pending a court order. The provider must hold them for **90 days** (renewable once).
    * **Why not others:** They do not have to keep everything for 2 years (A) automatically; only if requested.

**177. How did the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act) amend the production obligations of U.S. service providers?**
* **Answer: C. It clarified that providers must produce documents regardless of whether the communications are stored domestically or in a foreign country.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The CLOUD Act resolved the *Microsoft Ireland* case. It states that if a U.S. company controls the data, they must produce it, even if the server is physically in Dublin, Ireland.
    * **Why not others:** It did the opposite of A.

**178. Regarding enforcement, what is the nature of a violation of the Stored Communications Act at the federal level?**
* **Answer: B. It is a criminal offense punishable by fines and imprisonment (up to 10 years for malicious intent).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Like the Wiretap Act, violating the SCA (hacking into stored communications) is a federal crime.
    * **Why not others:** It's not just civil/FTC (A).

**179. Which of the following is true regarding legal remedies and State Attorney General enforcement for SCA violations?**
* **Answer: B. The Act provides for a private right of action, with minimum statutory damages of $1,000.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The SCA allows individuals to sue for violations (e.g., unauthorized access). The minimum statutory damages are generally **$1,000**. (Note: While some sources might reference higher caps for government liability, $1,000 is the standard minimum per person).
    * **Why not others:** State AGs (A) do not generally have a specific civil enforcement role under this federal criminal statute (unlike statutes like CAN-SPAM or TCPA where they do).

**180. Who is considered a "covered entity" subject to the CPNI privacy rules under the Telecommunications Act?**
* **Answer: B. Telecommunications carriers and interconnected voice-over-Internet (VoIP) providers.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Access is limited to Telecommunications Carriers and (by FCC regulation) VoIP providers. These are the pipes.
    * **Why not others:** Edge providers/Apps (D) like WhatsApp are generally NOT covered (a major policy debate point). Device makers (A) are not carriers.

**181. How does the law distinguish between "Customer Proprietary Network Information" (CPNI) and "Subscriber List Information"?**
* **Answer: B. CPNI consists of metadata like call destination and location; Subscriber List Information consists of public data like name and address.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** CPNI is the *sensitive* stuff: Who you call, when, how long, how much you pay. Subscriber List Info is the *public* stuff: Your name, address, and phone number (phone book info).
    * **Why not others:** A has it backward.

**182. Under the Act’s substantive rules, what is the required consent model for a carrier to share a customer's CPNI with a third-party Joint Venture partner for marketing?**
* **Answer: C. Opt-in consent (prior express authorization required).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The FCC rules have a sliding scale.
        *   Marketing *related* services to the customer? **Implied/No Consent**.
        *   Sharing with *Affiliates*? **Opt-Out**.
        *   Sharing with *Third Parties/Joint Ventures*? **Opt-In**.
    * **Why not others:** Opt-Out (B) is for affiliates, not 3rd parties.

**183. To ensure compliance with CPNI regulations, what administrative safeguard must a carrier perform annually?**
* **Answer: A. File an officer certification with the FCC stating the company is in compliance with the rules.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** This is a specific bureaucratic requirement. Every year, an officer must certify compliance.
    * **Why not others:** C is made up.

**184. In the event of a security breach involving CPNI, which of the following describes the correct notification procedure?**
* **Answer: B. The carrier must notify federal law enforcement (FBI/USSS) within 7 business days and wait to notify the customer until after that window.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is unique to CPNI. You must notify the US Secret Service and FBI *first*. You cannot notify the customer until 7 business days *after* telling the feds (unless they say it's okay sooner). This prevents tipping off hackers.
    * **Why not others:** A is the opposite (and dangerous in this context).

**185. Regarding legal remedies, what is true about the "Choice of Action" available to an individual for a violation of the Act?**
* **Answer: B. Individuals may choose to proceed before the FCC OR in federal court, but cannot do both.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The 1996 Act gives a private right of action but forces a choice: You can file a formal complaint with the FCC (administrative) OR sue in federal district court. You cannot double dip.
    * **Why not others:** C is false. D is not a prerequisite.

**186. Who is considered a "covered entity" subject to the requirements of Title VII?**
* **Answer: B. Employers with 15 or more employees, employment agencies, labor unions, and training programs.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Title VII defines an "employer" as engaged in industry affecting commerce with **15 or more** employees.
    * **Why not others:** It excludes small businesses (<15) (A). It applies to private sector, not just govt (C).

**187. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on which "protected classes"?**
* **Answer: B. Race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), or national origin.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** These are the original "Big Five" (plus pregnancy added later via PDA).
    * **Why not others:** Age/Disability/Genetics (A) are covered by separate laws (ADEA, ADA, GINA). Citizenship (D) is IRCA.

**188. How does the law define "disparate impact" in the context of employment practices?**
* **Answer: B. A practice that is facially neutral but falls more harshly on a protected group.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Access to jobs/promotions is blocked by a rule that *looks* fair (e.g., "Must be 6 feet tall") but disproportionately impacts a protected class (e.g., women or certain ethnic groups) without a business necessity.
    * **Why not others:** Intentional discrimination (A) is "Disparate Treatment."

**189. Under what specific exception is discrimination permitted under Title VII?**
* **Answer: B. If the trait is a "bona fide occupational qualification" (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the operation of the business.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** You can discriminate if it's a **BFOQ**. (e.g., hiring only female actors for a female role, or a religious school hiring only members of that faith). Note: Race can almost never be a BFOQ.
    * **Why not others:** General business interest (A) is not enough.

**190. What is the mandatory first step for an individual seeking to bring a claim of discrimination under Title VII?**
* **Answer: B. Filing a "charge" with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Before you can sue, you **MUST exhaust administrative remedies**. This means filing a formal charge with the EEOC (usually within 180 days).
    * **Why not others:** You cannot go straight to court (A).

**191. Regarding legal remedies, when may an aggrieved individual file a private civil action?**
* **Answer: C. If the EEOC finds no reasonable cause after a complaint is filed, or after the administrative process is exhausted.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Once the EEOC finishes its investigation (or if they take too long), they issue a **"Right to Sue" letter**. Only THEN can you file a lawsuit in federal court.
    * **Why not others:** A is prohibited. D is irrelevant.

**192. What specific event prompted the U.S. Congress to enact the Video Privacy Protection Act in 1988?**
* **Answer: B. The publication of Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork’s video rental history in a newspaper.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the famous origin story. A reporter got Judge Bork's video rental list (which was surprisingly boring) during his confirmation hearings. Congress was so spooked that they passed the VPPA immediately.
    * **Why not others:** It wasn't a breach (A) or piracy (C).

**193. Who is considered a "covered entity" under the VPPA, and how has this scope evolved?**
* **Answer: B. Any person engaged in the business of rental, sale, or delivery of prerecorded video cassette tapes or similar audio visual materials, now including streaming media services.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** While the text says "video cassette tapes," courts have broadly interpreted "similar audio visual materials" to cover streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu) and websites with video content.
    * **Why not others:** It's not limited to VHS (A).

**194. Under the VPPA Amendments of 2012, how long can a "one-time" consumer consent for the disclosure of viewing information remain valid?**
* **Answer: C. 2 years.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** The 2012 Amendment (pushed by Netflix for social sharing) allows users to give consent for ongoing sharing (e.g., auto-posting to Facebook) for up to **two years** (or until they withdraw it).
    * **Why not others:** It is not indefinite (D).

**195. According to the substantive rules regarding data destruction, when must a video tape service provider destroy personally identifiable information (PII)?**
* **Answer: B. As soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the date the information is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** This is the specific destruction mandate. Once the account is closed/transaction done, you must delete the PII within **one year**.
    * **Why not others:** Immediate deletion (A) isn't required.

**196. Regarding federal and state enforcement, which of the following is true?**
* **Answer: A. Violations of the VPPA constitute a criminal offense at the federal level.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s A:** Many privacy pros forget this: The VPPA is technically a criminal statute (though rarely enforced that way). It does NOT rely on the FTC or AGs primarily; it relies on the Private Right of Action.
    * **Why not others:** State AGs (B) don't have specific authority here.

**197. What is the statutory damage amount a plaintiff may recover in a private cause of action for improper disclosure under the VPPA?**
* **Answer: C. $2,500.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** This is one of the highest statutory minimums in privacy law: **$2,500** per violation (plus punitive damages attorney fees). This makes VPPA class actions very expensive/attractive.
    * **Why not others:** It is significantly higher than the standard $1,000 found in other laws (B).

**198. Who is considered a "covered entity" subject to the prohibitions of the Wiretap Act?**
* **Answer: B. Any "person" who intercepts a wire, oral, or electronic communication.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** Title I applies to everyone—private individuals and government agents alike. Anyone who "intercepts" (captures in transit) a communication is liable.
    * **Why not others:** It is NOT limited to govt (A) or telcos (C).

**199. How does the statute define an "oral communication" to distinguish it from other types?**
* **Answer: B. An "in-person" conversation where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** "Oral" means sound waves in the air (a chat in a room). The key legal test is whether the speakers had a **Reasonable Expectation of Privacy** (REP). If they shouted in public, it's not protected "oral communication."
    * **Why not others:** Cellular (A) is "Wire/Electronic." Voicemail (D) is "Stored."

**200. Under the federal one-party consent rule, an interception is NOT unlawful if:**
* **Answer: C. One of the persons involved in the communication has consented to the interception.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Federal law (and most states) uses **One-Party Consent**. As long as YOU (the commercial party or individual) are part of the conversation, you can record it without telling the other person (unless you are in a Two-Party state like CA/MA).
    * **Why not others:** Attorney status (A) is irrelevant.

**201. To obtain a "super-warrant" for a wiretap, law enforcement must satisfy several hurdles, including "minimization," which requires them to:**
* **Answer: C. Stop recording when a conversation is determined to be non-relevant to the investigation.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s C:** Wiretaps are intrusive. Police must **minimize** the interception of innocent calls. If the target calls his wife to talk about dinner, the agent must stop listening/recording immediately.
    * **Why not others:** It's about content, not equipment size (A).

**202. What is the status of federal preemption regarding the Wiretap Act?**
* **Answer: B. It does not preempt state law, allowing several states to enact stricter "dual-consent" statutes.**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s B:** The Wiretap Act sets a "floor," not a ceiling. States can be stricter. About a dozen states (California, Florida, Massachusetts, etc.) require **All-Party (Dual) Consent**.
    * **Why not others:** It does not fully preempt (A). Lenient "no-consent" (D) would violate the federal floor.

**203. Regarding legal remedies, what is the statutory damage floor an individual may recover for a private cause of action under 18 U.S.C. § 2520?**
* **Answer: D. $10,000 (or $100 per day of violation).**
* **Rationale:**
    * **Why it’s D:** Tapping is serious. The damages are **$100/day** OR **$10,000 statutory minimum**, whichever is higher.
    * **Why not others:** $1,000 (A) is typical for SCA, but Wiretap is $10k.
